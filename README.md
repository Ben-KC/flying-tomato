# Flying Tomato

## A blazing fast Pomodoro timer, written in Rust

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a helpful method of breaking tasks into 
intervals of work and break. A number of tools already exist for timing and tracking there intervals, but they all have 
one thing in common: they are incredibly slow. Flying Tomato seeks to solve that problem.

Being built in Rust, this Pomodoro timer is memory-safe, cross-platform, and blazing fast. Where most timers can take 
as long as 25 minutes to get through a work interval, Flying Tomato completes that same interval in under 25 
***seconds***!
